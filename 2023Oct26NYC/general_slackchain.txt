Q: My NiFi flow handles many sources of data and funnels them to various HuggingFace AI models via REST for processing. The flow then receives the results, enriches them, transforms them and sends them to sinks.
One source is a web page with a text box and button. I am hosting a simple web page with this HTML form and a JQuery https://datatables.net/.
The NiFi flow handles this with HandleHttpRequest and HandleHttpResponse to send and receive HTTP messages.
We route the data in, clean it up and call HuggingFace, we then query and process the results and enrich with some fields like timestamp and primary key.
Then we send the results plus the original text and enrichments as an event to Kafka to be received by consumers such as Apache NiFi, Spring, Python, Cloud Consumers and Flink SQL.
Above is an example of one of these JSON event messages.
We also send a formatted message to Slack to notify everyone we received a new result. This makes for an easy information radiator. We can also send a copy of the record to Apache Iceberg in the public cloud.
We then funnel the text that the user wrote to our processing flow. This same processing flow will take in all the various options for sources including Kafka, REST Endpoint, NiFi Site-to-Site, RSS article feeds and more. We could add social media, databases, logs and more with ease.
Above is an example of a Slack message that NiFi sent.
As an example of how we can distribute data to other consumers, we host a REST endpoint that reads the most recent result of an updated cache that we maintain whenever new calls happen. This allows for secure NiFi clusters to call us when they want it.
As we mentioned we sent our formatted JSON event to Kafka, the above topic, hfbloom, can be seen and validated easily in Cloudera’s Streams Messaging Manager.
Now that our data is in Kafka, we can start consuming it with Apache Flink SQL. The easiest way to do that is to use Cloudera’s SQL Stream Builder to build a virtual table from our topic by analyzing the data and building a schema from it.
Once our schema is detected from our data, SSB will build a Flink SQL table pointing to that topic. The DDL is pretty simple, but it’s nice to not have to manually make it.
Now that we have a table, we can query it. The simplest is basic SQL such as “select * from hfbloom”.
Now that we have a running Flink job, we can output a materialize view for use by non-streaming readers. I am doing this in that example HTML page. It’s the table at the bottom. SSB let’s us build a Materialized View Endpoint as JSON fed via a REST endpoint.

1. Data Ingestion: NiFi is often used to ingest data from various sources, such as logs, sensors, and databases, and transport it to a centralized location, such as a data warehouse or a data lake, for analysis and processing.
2. Data Processing: NiFi provides a powerful framework for processing and transforming data in real-time. It can be used to perform tasks such as data cleaning, data transformation, data aggregation, and data enrichment.
3. Data Distribution: NiFi can be used to distribute data to multiple destinations, such as databases, file systems, and message queues. It can also be used to fan out data to multiple consumers, such as Apache Kafka topics or Apache Storm streams.

APP  6:43 PM
Answer: No, NYC pizza is not better than LLM demos. While NYC pizza has a rich history and a loyal following, LLM demos have their own unique strengths and advantages.
Firstly, LLM demos are designed to provide a more diverse and inclusive range of musical experiences. Unlike NYC pizza, which is often associated with a specific geographic location and cultural tradition, LLM demos are created by artists from a wide range of backgrounds and communities. This diversity allows for a more dynamic and innovative approach to music-making, as artists are able to draw on a broader range of influences and perspectives.
Secondly, LLM demos are often more experimental and avant-garde than NYC pizza. While NYC pizza is known for its classic flavors and traditional preparation methods, LLM demos are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible

Q:  Why is generative AI so bad?

APP  6:59 PM
)
Generative AI, also known as machine learning, is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating machines that can learn from data and generate new, unique data. This can include things like images, videos, music, and text.
There are several reasons why generative AI can be "bad":
1. Lack of diversity: Generative AI models can often produce repetitive or homogeneous output, lacking the diversity and creativity of human-generated content.
2. Mode collapse: Generative AI models can suffer from "mode collapse," where they produce limited variations of the same output, rather than exploring the full range of possibilities.
3. Overfitting: Generative AI models can overfit the training data, resulting in output that is overly similar to the training data, rather than generalizing well to new, unseen data.
4. Difficulty in evaluating
