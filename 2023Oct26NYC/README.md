Adding Generative AI to Real-Time Streaming Pipelines | Timothy Spann
In this talk, Tim will discuss the basics of real-time streaming, walk through the tools used including Apache NiFi, Apache Kafka and Apache Flink and show how to build a real-time streaming pipeline that sends prompts to LLMs hosted by the likes of Hugging Face, IBM and Cloudera. He will also discuss where real-time data stores like Apache Pinot come into play.
He will show a detailed demonstration of a few use cases involving different sources of data including Kafka, Medium Articles and interactive Question and Response in Slack. He will then show you how you can build your own and where areas of growth exist.
Tim Spann is a Principal Developer Advocate in Data In Motion for Cloudera. He works with Apache NiFi, Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, Apache Flink, Flink SQL, Apache Pinot, Trino, Apache Iceberg, DeltaLake, Apache Spark, Big Data, IoT, Cloud, AI/DL, machine learning, and deep learning. Tim has over ten years of experience with the IoT, big data, distributed computing, messaging, streaming technologies, and Java programming. Previously, he was a Developer Advocate at StreamNative, Principal DataFlow Field Engineer at Cloudera, a Senior Solutions Engineer at Hortonworks, a Senior Solutions Architect at AirisData, a Senior Field Engineer at Pivotal and a Team Leader at HPE. He blogs for DZone, where he is the Big Data Zone leader, and runs a popular meetup in Princeton & NYC on Big Data, Cloud, IoT, deep learning, streaming, NiFi, the blockchain, and Spark. Tim is a frequent speaker at conferences such as ApacheCon, DeveloperWeek, Pulsar Summit and many more.

Apache Pinot and Kafka an excellent pairing for refined palates | Tim Veil

The other Tim, Tim Veil, will dive into the history and architecture of Apache Pinot and share why Pinot is a perfect compliment to streaming technologies like Apache Kafka. If you are a connoisseur of fine technologies you will enjoy this excellent pairing.
Tim is the VP of Solutions Engineering and Enablement at StarTree. He is an avid reader and golfer. He is the father of three girls, two of which are teenagers. As a result he spends most evenings hiding in his room hoping the yelling stops soon.

  Prompt: Q: How do IBM and Cloudera collaborate on Cloudera DataFlow?
Response: )
IBM and Cloudera have a strategic partnership to offer Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) on IBM Cloud. CDF is a data processing engine that allows users to process and analyze data in real-time, batch, or stream processing modes. IBM provides the underlying infrastructure for CDF on IBM Cloud, while Cloudera provides the CDF software and support.
Through this partnership, customers can deploy CDF on IBM Cloud to process and analyze large amounts of data from various sources, including IoT devices, sensors, and other data sources. The collaboration between IBM and Cloudera allows customers to take advantage of the scalability and reliability of IBM Cloud, along with the data processing capabilities of CDF.
In addition, IBM and Cloudera work together to provide joint support and services to customers, ensuring that they have a seamless experience when using CDF on IBM
