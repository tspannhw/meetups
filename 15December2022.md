### HYBRID: Learn how to use Apache Pulsar, Apache Flink, and Apache NiFi

Location:

TigerLabs in Princeton on the 2nd floor, walk up and the door will be open. Same that we were using for the old Future of Data - Princeton events 2016-2019.

Parking at the school is free. street parking nearby is free. there are meters on some streets, and a few blocks away is a paid parking garage.

We are joining forces with our friends Cloudera again on a FLiPN amazing journey into Real-Time Streaming Applications with Apache Flink, Apache NiFi, and Apache Pulsar.

Discover how to stream data to and from your data lake or data mart using Apache Pulsar™ and Apache NiFi®. Learn how these cloud-native, scalable open-source projects built for streaming data pipelines work together to enable you to quickly build applications with minimal coding.

|WHAT THE SESSION WILL COVER|

Apache NiFi
Apache Pulsar
Apache Flink
Flink SQL
We will show you how to build apps, so download beforehand to Docker, K8, your Laptop, or the cloud.
