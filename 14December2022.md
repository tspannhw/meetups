“Building Real-Time Requires a Team”- Tim Spann, Developer Advocate @ StreamNative
This talk will discuss building real-time streaming applications utilizing the best open-source systems. This FLiPPN Stack consisting of Apache Flink, Apache Pulsar, Apache Pinot, and Apache NiFi supercharges any real-time app or pipeline building. I will walk you through the what, why, how, and where to use these amazing tools. We will walk through some demos and dive into the source. At the end, we will have driven real-time events into Apache Pinot, setting the stage for your real-time user-facing insights.
